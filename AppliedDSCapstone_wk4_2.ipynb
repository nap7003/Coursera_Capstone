    "We will analyze and compare neighborhoods between New York City, New York and Toronto, ON, Canada in this project. Our client in North East Asia wants to set up a new North America branch, and Toronto and New York City were selected as the two cities for their final decision. The company wants some insight into the neighborhoods and local businesses in the cities so that its employees can have quality of life while they work or live in the city. This project will explore the similarities and dissimilarities between certain neighborhoods in the two cities, and suggest which neighborhoods would fit the culture of the client's employees the best."
